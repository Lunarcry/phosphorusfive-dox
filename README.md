# Phosphorus Five, the beginner's guide

Welcome to the book about Phosphorus Five. Phosphorus Five, also referred to as P5 in this guide, is a lot of different things. It is a simple design pattern, it is an Ajax library, it is a programming language, and it is a framework. Some would also argue that it is a web operating system. What you choose to refer to it as, is really quite irrelevant. The point is that it solves your problems, particularly the ones you’re having, as you try to create rich and interactive web apps. P5 is explicitly created to ease your burden when you wish to create rich interactive, single page web apps. This book aims at being your _“one stop guide”_, as you start out with P5. A beginner’s introduction. Starting out at the _“for dummies level”_, and hopefully moving you on to the expert’s level.

This book assumes some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, but does not require you to know JavaScript and/or C# from before. However, some basic knowledge of JavaScript and C#, might be beneficial, since we will dive into these technologies in some of the chapters. You can still perfectly take advantage of it, even if you have never created as much as a single line of code in neither JavaScript, C#, nor any other programming languages.

The main programming language in P5 is called *"Hyperlambd"*, and will be the programming language used for 99% of our examples. We will guide you through how to create Hyperlambda code, carefully and thoroughly, in this book.
