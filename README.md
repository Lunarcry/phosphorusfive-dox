# Phosphorus Five, the beginner's guide

Welcome to the book about Phosphorus Five. Phosphorus Five, also referred to as P5 in this guide, is a lot of different things. It is a simple design pattern, it is an Ajax library, it is a programming language, and it is a framework. Some would also argue that it is a web operating system. What you choose to refer to it as, is really quite irrelevant. The point is that it solves your problems, particularly the ones you’re having, as you try to create rich and interactive web apps. P5 is explicitly created to ease your burden when you wish to create rich interactive, single page web apps. This book aims at being your _“one stop guide”_, as you start out with P5. A beginner’s introduction. Starting out at the _“for dummies level”_, and hopefully moving you on to the expert’s level.

This book assumes some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, but does not require you to know JavaScript and/or C# from before. However, some basic knowledge of JavaScript and C#, might be beneficial, since we will dive into these technologies in some of the chapters. You can still perfectly take advantage of it, even if you have never created as much as a single line of code in neither JavaScript, C#, nor any other programming languages.

The main programming language in P5 is called *"Hyperlambda"*, and will be the programming language used for 99% of our examples. We will guide you through how to create Hyperlambda code, carefully and thoroughly, in this book.

The book is licensed under the terms of the GPL, version 3, just like Phosphorus Five is. If you haven't yet, then [download Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive) first.

The book's convention, is created carefully to allow you to uderstand what is being described. First of all, any property or attribute from Hyperlambda is referenced like **[this]**, where "this" assumes a node's name. This convention is used whenever a node is referenced inline in the text.

Inline code is writte like `this` and multiple lines of code is written like the following illustrates.

```
howdy-world
  this-is:A piece of Hyperlambda code!
```

## Advanced topics

Advanced topics, which is not necessary to understand, in order to master P5, is explicitly marked as such. You will often find a link closed to where a topic has been marked as advanced, allowing you to easily skip the advanced parts. Often, the advanced topics of P5, is given inline, to preserve context. This means, that advanced topics, are equally easily found in the beginning of the book, as they are at the end of the book.

You can easily skip advanced topics though, in your first read through, for later to refer to them, as the need surfaces.

## Downloading the book

Periodically, I will create a download of the book, which you can read locally. This will be in the formats offered by GitHub, such as .zip and .tar.gz. These downloads are the *"raw source"* of the book, which is in Markdown format. It could probably be beneficial for you to use a Markdown editor, or viewer, to read the book. I personally use *"MacDown"* for writing the book. Another great viewer, for Windows, would be *"Markdown Monster"*.

This way of distributing the book, allows you to create inline comments, as you read it, maybe providing answers for excersizes, or comments on constructs, etc, as you read it. It also allows you to easily create patches and additions to the book, and supply to me on email.

My email address is thomas@gaiasoul.com, and you can find the book's main source at [GitHub](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive-dox), which is the place where I prefer you to submit feedback about the book, if you have any.
