# Phosphorus Five, the guide

Welcome to the book about Phosphorus Five. Phosphorus Five, also referred to as P5 in this guide, is a lot of different things. It is a simple design pattern, it is an Ajax library, it is a programming language, and it is a framework. Some would also argue that it is a web operating system. What you choose to refer to it as, is really quite irrelevant. The point is that it solves your problems, particularly the ones you’re having, as you try to create rich and interactive web apps. P5 is explicitly created to ease your burden when you wish to create rich interactive, single page web apps. This book aims at being your _“one stop guide”_, as you start out with P5. A beginner’s introduction. Starting out at the _“for dummies level”_, and hopefully moving you on to the expert’s level.

## The goal of the book

During the first part of this book, I will teach you everything you need to know, to create your own contacts database, to keep track of your friends adresses, emails, phone numbers, etc. My aim is to bring you up to this knowledge in P5, within less than a day. That way, the book becomes very practical, and hands on, and you can feel that you have done something constructive by reading it.

## Prerequisites for reading

This book assumes some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, but does not require you to know JavaScript and/or C# from before. However, some basic knowledge of JavaScript and C#, might be beneficial, since we will dive into these technologies in some of the chapters. You can still perfectly take advantage of it, even if you have never created as much as a single line of code in neither JavaScript, C#, nor any other programming languages. This book does not assume you're a programmer from before.

## Technologies visited

The main programming language in P5 is called *"Hyperlambda"*, and will be the programming language used for 99% of our examples. We will guide you through how to create Hyperlambda code, carefully and thoroughly, in this book.

## A guide to the guide

The book's convention, is created carefully to allow you to uderstand what is being described. First of all, any property or attribute from Hyperlambda is referenced like **[this]**, where "this" assumes a node's name. This convention is used whenever a node is referenced inline in the text.

Inline code is writte like `this` and multiple lines of code is written like the following illustrates.

```
howdy-world
  this-is:A piece of Hyperlambda code!
```

### How to read the book

Advanced topics, which is not necessary to understand, in order to master P5, is explicitly marked as such. You will often find a link close to where a topic has been marked as advanced, allowing you to easily skip the advanced parts. Often, the advanced topics of P5, is given inline, to preserve context. This means, that advanced topics, are equally easily found in the beginning of the book, as they are at the end of the book.

You can easily skip these advanced topics though, in your first read through, for later to refer to them, as the need surfaces. This ensures that the book is not only a beginner's guide, but also of use for the *"Shaolin Ninja master P5 developers"*.

In general, there are 3 different ways of reading this book. There is the *"beginner's guide"*, which assumes you do not read any of the advanced chapters. This allows you to rapidly get up to speed in your understanding of P5. This type of reading can probably be done in a day, following simple copy and paste tutorial examples, intended to demonstrate some simple ideas, allowing you to gain terrain rapidly, as you start out with P5. Then there's the *"master's read through"*, which is intended for a second reading of the book. This is a much more thoroughly explanation, intended to give you knowledge of every gory little detail of P5. This reading, assumes you read the *"advanced chapters"*. Then, finally, there's the *"reference guide"* version, allowing you to use the book as a reference guide, when you need to repeat your knowledge of some particular subject of P5.

If this is your first encounter with P5, I would encourage you to skip all the *"advanced chapters"*, to get you up to speed as fast as possible. This type of reading actually expects you to start out your reading at [chapter 2](chapter-2.md).

## Downloading the book

Periodically, I will create a download of the book, which you can read locally. This will be in the formats offered by GitHub, such as .zip and .tar.gz. These downloads are the *"raw source"* of the book, which is in Markdown format. It could probably be beneficial for you to use a Markdown editor, or viewer, to read the book. I personally use *"MacDown"* for writing the book. Another great viewer, for Windows, would be *"Markdown Monster"*.

This way of distributing the book, allows you to create inline comments, as you read it, maybe providing answers for excersizes, or comments on constructs, etc, as you read it. It also allows you to easily create patches and additions to the book, and supply to me on email.

My email address is thomas@gaiasoul.com, and you can find the book's main source at [GitHub](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive-dox), which is the place where I prefer you to submit feedback about the book, if you have any.

## License

The book is licensed under the terms of the GPL, version 3, just like Phosphorus Five is.

I could probably have chosen a license such as Creative Commons, which would be a more *"logical"* choice. However, partially as a funny joke, and partially out of respect for P5 and the GPL, and partially since this book is written in Markdown syntax, I have chosen to release it as GPL, to make sure anyone why *"executes it"*, are legally allowed to gain access to its *"source code"*, which is in Markdown format.

If you are reading this book somewhere online, you can ask those who gave you access to it for its *"source code"*, which are to be supplied in the format of Markdown files. This ensures that the book stays open, and alive, and becomes modifiable to suite your custom needs, if any.

*"Sharing is caring"*

And remember; **Don't panic!**
