# Hyperlambda leads to Hyperhumble

In the introduction to the book, we discussed how Hyperlambda have more *"feminine qualities"*, and *"balances your hemisphere"*, due to changing the way you think. In this chapter, we will discuss these ideas more thoroughly, from the lessons learned from the two previous chapters.

The name of this chapter might sound absurd for the uninitiated. However, before you discard the chapter entirely, let me start out with a statement; *"I agree with everything you think"*.

I am not sure if my last statement made this chapter sound even more absurd, or if it changed your perception - But let me explain anyways ...

## Playing with ideas

In the previous two chapters, we saw how we could pass around logic, to *"functions"*, encapsulated, such that we could *inject* our own logic, into pre-existing *"functions"* (actually Active Events, but it doesn't matter).

This, as we discussed in chapter 8, facilitates for better visualization skills, since it forces you to visualize, that which is not there - Which results in that it *trains* your ability to visualize.

This creates a *new skill*, namely the ability to *"play with logic within your head"*. This, combined with the morphism features of Hyperlambda, allows you to become more open minded to other people's perceptions, and ideas about things in general. Simply, because you can allow to play with another person's ideas, in your head, following them, trying to perceive the consequences of these ideas, *before* you act upon them.

This creates a larger amount of *discernment*. In addition, your argumentation techniques, tend to change, and become more persuasive in nature - Simply since you focus less on *"what you say"*, and more on *"how to 'plant' your lambda (meme) correctly into the minds of others"*.

The results of this, tends to become less quarreling, and more persuasiveness, because you start out your arguments with *"you might be right"*. Which of course, creates *rapport*, giving you a golden opportunity, to influence others, by moving unto their side of an argument, and slowly bringing them towards your side - Realising that this process, doesn't do any permanent changes to your own point of view, since you can always *"polymorphistically"* change your view later, back to whatever it was originally - Or *"overwrite an Active Event (piece of logic)"*, as it no longer suites your needs.

## STOP CLASSIFYING ME, or wait ...

Due to the lack of classes in Hyperlambda, you will not feel the need for classifying people into *absolutes*. For instance, is a racist only a racist? Some doctors are probably racists. Some rocket scientists are probably racists. Some Afro Americans are also probably racists. By discarding a *"racist as only a racist"*, you have lost an opportunity to both learn from the good parts of this *"racists"*, in addition to loosing a golden opportunity to *influence* the racist - Such that he or she might potentially change his or hers opinion over time, due to you having *influenced* the person.

This process though, can only occur, if you focus more on what you *agree* with the person in regards to - And focus *less* on what you disagree with the person about. This is simple psychology, and scientific *"influential theory"*. Hyperlambda, due to its ability to *mold* lambda objects, which are really quite similar to *memes*, or *ideas*, lets you train your ability to *influence* others, by slowly learning the techniques, necessary to *plant new seeds* inside the minds of others. You *become* a walking piece of Hyperlambda, capable of having others, execute upon your lambda objects.

From a Neuro Linguistic Programming point of view, it first of all changes the way you think, making you become less certain. Secondly, as it does, it trains your mind, to be able to reproduce this process in others.

Its greater amount of cohesion, also tends to reflect unto your communication skills, and make you more *precise* in regards to your linguistics - While still retaining your *softness*, making you appear to be everybody's friend - Which paradoxically inevitably is one its side-effects.

## The toughest man on Earth

Arguably, the toughest man-man that ever lived was Bruce Lee. Few would object to this. However, Bruce Lee was though, because he was soft. He was able to balance his masculinity with his feminine qualities. He was *"balancing his Yin and Yan"*, to use an ancient analogy. He was magically convincing, due to his uncertainty in himself. He was unbelievably hard, due to his extreme softness. He was a marvelous teacher, because he accepted that he could learn something from everyone. He was in *"both places at the same time"*.

I'd therefor like to do something which is probably highly unusual to do in a book about programming, supposedly intended to be a purely *logical thing* - Which is to finish this chapter with a poem. Which was given by Bruce Lee, in the forms of an interview.

*"Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put water into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water my friend."*

Bruce Lee

If you wish to see the video, where he is giving this interview, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ).

For the record, I am perfectly fine with whatever classification you'd like to put me into, as long as you make sure you put me into *every single classification that has ever existed!* Hence, I admit it, I am a racist! Let's not forget though; gay, satanist, transexual, coward, fascist, kommunist, evil, stupid, ignorant, terrorist, insane, violent, psychotic, fruitcake, retard, selfish egotistical man chauvinistic bastard ... ;)

Must important of them all of course; **Liar**. If I forgot something, please [let me know](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive-dox/issues).

And if you prefer referring to Hyperlambda as Hyperbullshit, I am perfectly fine with that. I am done fighting your preconcieved notions about me, and my work anyways, simply because; *"I am water!"* :)
