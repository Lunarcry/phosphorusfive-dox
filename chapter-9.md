# The bug

**True store**; In the 1950s, an American car manufacturer wanted to offshore the creation of some parts of their cars to a Japanese sub contracter. They were naturally very concerned, although the math had shown them, that they were going to save a lot of money in the process. So they wrote an extremely detailed specification, covering all aspects of the expectancy to the deliverance. As a part of their specification, they had written down the maximum amount of fault tolerance to the delivery, being some small percentage, which they expected to go wrong. After a couple of months, a ship comes to America, with the parts from Japan. There was one big package and one smaller package next to it. In addition, there was a letter of explanation, next to the deliverance. The letter said; *"Although we do not understand why you would want some pieces to not function correctly, we have delivered these malfunctioning parts in the small box"*.

If you find any bugs in this book, please [let me know](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive-dox/issues). This chapter should be the only bug in the book, in accordance to Japanese Zen philosophy!
